Test `local-npm` speed
===

This is a test to check the `npm install` times for [local-npm](https://github.com/nolanlawson/local-npm/) compared to normal `npm` against the main registry (https://registry.npmjs.org).

The test was run on a MacBook Air, with node 5.3.0 and npm 3.3.12. I'm on a slow-ish public WiFi at a caf√© in Brooklyn.

I started off with a small repo of mine, `nolanlawson/tiny-queue`, then moved on to some popular libraries like `lodash/lodash` and `facebook/react`. In each case, I'm just cloning the code from Github and running `npm install`.

**TLDR:** Regular npm is faster for the first `npm install`, but afterwards `local-npm` is always faster, even after `npm cache clear`. Sometimes it's even 2x or 3x faster (e.g. 1m15.752s vs 3m50.467s to install `facebook/react` the 2nd time).

Notes
---

Note that the test is a little unfair, because my `local-npm` has already downloaded all the metadata, but this is a typical use-case for `local-npm`. (It replicates the npm metadata on first run, which can take a few hours.) I did clear out the tarballs before the test, though.

Also, repos tested later in the test may benefit from a slight boost, if they share any modules with a previous repo. But again, this is a typical use-case for `local-npm` &ndash; the idea is that the more you use it, the faster it gets.


Reproduce these results
---

Just clone this repo and run `npm run test`. The python script can print a summary.

**Note:** the test will override your local `~/.npmrc` file! So you may want to do `npmrc -c testing && npmrc testing` beforehand.
